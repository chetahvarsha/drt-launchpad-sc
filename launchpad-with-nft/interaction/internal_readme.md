title: Internal launchpad SC setup & deploy procedure
---

This document provides a description of the Launchpad Smart Contract setup, deploy, integration & flow procedures as according to Dharitri's internal strategy & infrastructure.
It contains only a superseding specification over the internal_readme.md of the original Launchpad SC. Thus, the steps described in here should be applied over the ones specified by the original document.

Community projects may use this procedure only as FYI in regards to the general flow of the contract usage. Most of the steps can be abstracted and may be relevant to provide a general overview on how the contract operates, but some parts will not be relevant since access to Dharitri internal resources is not available (such as ticket allocation calculation) though these are not critical for running the contract.

## Internal launchpad SC setup & deploy procedure

### Prerequisites

- In addition to the original prerequisites, we’ll need the **Token Name and Ticker** for the SFT the contract will create to manage the Mistery Box sell.

### Steps

#### Contract deploy & scripts config for control

1. Get a wallet with pem file & mnemonic available, some REWA for fees/gas

2. Go to `sc-launchpad-rs/launchpad-with-nft/interaction` and copy the wallet .pem file in here

3. Edit `snippets.sh` with all launchpad contract details for deployment - this will be the “control panel” on Numbat’s side. Care for the NFT_COST parameter, as it is a merged formats input.

8. After deployment, setup the Mistery box handling then proceed with contract checking for sanity:

 - execute the following commands and care to wait for complete processing in between them:
 ```
$ issueMysterySft [SFT-Name] [SFT-Ticket]
$ createInitialSfts
$ setInitialTransferRole
 ```

#### Winners selection

24. In additionl to the original functions, call function until completed:
```
$ selectNftWinners
```
Or via normal tx towards the contract address with Gas Limit: `7000000` and data:
```
selectNftWinners
```

#### Claim

25. In addition to the original claim, ask the counterpart to claim the mistery box payment by executing:
```
$ claimNftPayment
```
Or via normal tx towards the contract address with Gas Limit: `7000000` and data:
```
claimNftPayment
```

#### Further actions related to handling of the SFT (e.g. additional mistery box contract)

26. In order to whitelist transfers of the SFT towards a specified address that can manage the mistery box functionality (e.g. IGO Smart Contract), execute the following function from the Launchpad V2 SC:
```
$ setTransferRole [New-SFT-Handling-Address]
```


All done.
